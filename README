PostgreSQL Fork with slightly upgraded psql
==========================

Same as upstream, but psql (REL_12_STABLE) has an added feature of "named queries".
This feature reads a separate file pointed by environmental variable PGNQFILE,
and looks for special markers in sql-comments.

You can invoke queries by their name within psql session, and you can
pass arguments to them. Substitution is litteral.
Vanilla psql allows to save queries and to retrieve them by name with variables
(\set Q1 'select true'; :Q1), but 
- they can't span multiple lines
- you can't pass arguments
- you can save variables ith queries inside .psqlrc, but it will be intermixed with psql commands,
	which kinda hurts readability




Example below:

file ".nqfile":
--nq:q1
SELECT @{0}
--nq:end

--nq:q2
UPDATE @{0}
SET bla=true 
WHERE false=true
--nq:end

$ export PGNQFILE=".nqfile"
$ psql

db=# \nq
q2
q1

db=# \nq+
   List named queries
 Name |    Definition    
------+------------------
 q2   | UPDATE @{0}     +
      | SET bla=true    +
      | WHERE false=true+
      | 
 q1   | SELECT @{0}     +
      | 
(4 rows)


db=# \nq q1 42
 ?column? 
----------
       42
(1 row)
